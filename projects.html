                    virtual operating system kernel (jan 2025 - may 2025): 
                    built virtual kernel in C++ and x86 assembly. implemented cooperative and preemptive multithreaded
                    operating systems emulated 
                    by QEMU. implemented Ext2 file system capable of traversing directories 
                    and interpreting files and symbolic links. included virtual memory functionality to allow 
                    for creation and maintenance of user processes. simulated PS/2 keyboard and mouse drivers 
                    through utilization of QEMU's emulation of PS/2 controller, allowing for interpretation of user input.

                    instruction pipeline emulator (nov 2024 - dec 2024): 
                    simulated five-stage processor pipeline for virtual central processing unit in C and ARM64 assembly. 
                    implemented emulation of 
                    necessary hardware 
                    including arithmetic logic unit and general purpose registers. implemented core 
                    functionality that fetches, decodes, and executes computer instructions; accesses memory; and writes back to 
                    pertinent GPRs. increased throughput and processor efficiency via implmentation of instruction forwarding and 
                    hazard control.

                    <br>
                    dynamic memory allocator (oct 2024): simulated heap memory allocation in C and ARM64 assembly. 
                    implemented worst-fit free block list ordering. improved throughput and space utilization by implementing 
                    first-fit list ordering. 
                    included heap consistency checker to ensure stability of programs and prevent 
                    memory leakage.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    command interpreter (sept 2024): developed command interpreter in C. included functionality 
                    for unary, binary, and ternary expressions in custom expression evaluation language. 
                    implemented tokenization of user input capable of interpreting integers, 
                    booleans, strings, and variables. 
                    included error handling for lexical, syntactic, type inference, 
                    and evaluation errors.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    huffman file compressor (apr 2024): developed logic for file compression in Java. 
                    utilized Huffman codes to compress and decompress files of any type. included array-based and 
                    tree-based compression formats.
