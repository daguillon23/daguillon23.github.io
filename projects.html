                    virtual operating system kernel (january 2025 - may 2025): 
                    written in C++ and x86 assembly. initially built virtual kernel for cooperative, multithreaded operating system emulated 
                    by QEMU. 
                    later upgraded to preemptive
                    operating system. implemented Ext2 file system capable of traversing directories 
                    and interpreting files and symbolic links. included virtual memory functionality to allow 
                    for creation and maintenance of user processes. simulated PS/2 keyboard and mouse drivers 
                    through utilization of QEMU's emulation of PS/2 controller.

                    instruction pipeline emulator (november 2024 - december 2024): 
                    written in C and ARM64 assembly. simulated five-stage processor pipeline for virtual central processing unit. 
                    implemented emulation of 
                    necessary hardware 
                    including arithmetic logic unit and general purpose registers. implemented core 
                    functionality that fetches, decodes, and executes computer instructions; accesses memory; and writes back to 
                    pertinent GPRs. increased throughput and processor efficiency via implmentation of instruction forwarding.

                    huffman file compressor (april 2024): school project. 
                    written in Java. uses Huffman codes to compress and decompress files of any type.
